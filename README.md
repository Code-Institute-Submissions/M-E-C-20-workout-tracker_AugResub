# Workout Tracker
## MS3 Code Institute Project - Data Centric Development

![Responsive](static/images/responsive_demo.jpg)

Workout Tracker is a simple to use responsive website for tracking weight training workouts. Users will be directed to either log in or register from the welcome page. From there they will be able to plan workouts by adding exercises with sets and reps to a certain day. From there they can edit, delete or mark as done and view completed workouts as needed.

There is a search function in which the user can search for specific exercises performed to view progression. The website layout will be minimalist and clear, in order to make viewing and updating workout information simple during or after performing a workout, when a user may be fatigued.
