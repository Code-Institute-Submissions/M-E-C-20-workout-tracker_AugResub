# Workout Tracker
## MS3 Code Institute Project - Data Centric Development

![Responsive](static/images/responsive_demo.jpg)

Workout Tracker is a simple to use responsive website for tracking weight training workouts. Users will be directed to either log in or register from the welcome page. From there they will be able to plan workouts by adding exercises with sets and reps to a certain day. From there they can edit, delete or mark as done and view completed workouts as needed.

There is a search function in which the user can search for specific exercises performed to view progression. The website layout will be minimalist and clear, in order to make viewing and updating workout information simple during or after performing a workout, when a user may be fatigued.

## UX

### User Stories

- As a new user, I wish to be directed to the appropriate place to register to the Workout Tracker.
- As a new user, I would like to create a personal profile to log my workouts.
- As a returning user, I want to be able to log in to my own personal user profile.
- As a returning user, I want to be able to plan workouts for the future.
- As a returning user, I want to have the ability to edit planned workouts in case I feel my circumstances have changed.
- As a returning user, I wish to view my previous workouts so that I can compare my exercise progression results.
- As the owner, I want to present an intuitive minimalist style application that allows a user to easily navigate the site.
- As the owner, the application must be responsive, to allow users to track their workouts as they train, or to have the choice of adding, editing or deleting their workout data from any other device.

### Strategy

The Workout Tracker is designed to be usable instead of logging workouts in a paper journal. By making a responsive application, this can be done easily while training or at the user's leisure on a desktop or any device. 

### Scope
It is important to display an intuitive minimalist design as users that log their workouts while training do not want to spend excess time navigating the application and may be fatigued also, which could impair concentration.

### Structure

In each section I want to keep a common navbar which will stick to the page top. Users can use this to navigate the site easily without the use of browser forward and back buttons.

### Surface

#### Colours

- For the navbar and page headings, I used the Materialize color class grey darken-3 (#424242).
- For each page body I used the Materialize color class grey lighten-1 (#bdbdbd).
- For the cards which contained the site content I used the Materialize color class grey lighten-3 (#eeeeee).
- For contrast on buttons and on navbar content I used the Materialize color class amber (#ffc107).

I found the use of these colours to provide a nice soft contrast that wasn't harsh to look.

### Icons

#### All icons used in this project were sourced from Font Awesome

- I used the hamburger icon for my menu because it is widely recognised and used for mobile menus.
- I used the external link icon to indicate the presence of a clickable link on the welcome page to help direct users to either the log in or registration pages.
- I used the double arrow up icon on the completed workout cards to indicate that additional workout notes could be viewed upon clickiing the button.
-  I used the plus icon on adding workout data to emphasise the add workout button.
- I used the search icon on the search button to emphasise its use.
